       Last time I talked about the fact that during my childhood, nature was much closer to the inhabitants of the village than now. And she was much more alive. And most importantly, we and our parents were not particularly afraid of this proximity. Parents did not care that “someone had gone across the river,” or that “children alone were playing somewhere in the Cossack robbers”. And not because of some callousness and lack of love for children, but rather because the environment of the village was considered quite safe in those years.<br>

The place of behavior is somewhere between the village and the Brigade.<br>

Dense and sun-smelling dust comes from a path broken by hundreds of runners. Heart palpitations at the start. A desperate lack of oxygen at the finish. Looking forward to the announcement of the results. And something else that was irretrievably lost along with childhood ...
